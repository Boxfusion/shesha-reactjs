# Overview

Shesha is an open source low-code software development framework. The target audience is mainly developers and business analysts who develop enterprise applications.

Shesha is a Zulu slang term for fast or go quicker and it is meant to convey the speed at which the platform will allow someone to create a solution by plugging together “lego blocks” rather than hand coding something from scratch.
